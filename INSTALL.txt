
    For installation notes relating to specific systems, please skip to the next
    section of this document.

                                   -------

    On WIN32 using either Visual C/C++ or WATCOM, build by the following these steps:

      a. Install the gnuwin32 tool set or similar. (optional) set the PATH environment
        variable to include the win32 sub-directory which contains console versions
        of several GNU tools, including gmake.

            Source, http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/

        Notes:

         o gmake bundled with gnuwin32 is 3.81 wont function correctly as
           GNU make 4.0 or greater shall be required to build several packages.


      b. If you dont have perl available, download and install. 
         ActivePerl is one of the better options.


      c. Run the `makelib.pl' perl script by typing:

         o MSVC, 2015+ or greater

            perl makelib.pl [--gnuwin32=<path-gnuwin32-bin>] vc[2015|2017|2019]


         o OpenWatcom 1.9 or 2.0 (beta at your caution).

            perl makelib.pl owc


      d. Build the entire tree with:

            gmake
