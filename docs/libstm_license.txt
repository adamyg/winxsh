   libtsm - Terminal-emulator State Machine

	TSM is a state machine for DEC VT100-VT520 compatible terminal emulators. It tries to
	support all common standards while keeping compatibility to existing emulators like xterm, 
	gnome-terminal, konsole, ..

	TSM itself does not provide any rendering nor window management. It is a simple plain
	state machine without any external dependencies. It can be used to implement terminal
	emulators, but also to implement other applications that need to interpret terminal
	escape sequences.

	This library is very similar to libvte of the gnome project. However, libvte is highly
	bound to GTK+, which makes it unsuitable for non-graphics projects that need to parse
	escape sequences. Instead, TSM tries to restrict its API to terminal emulation only.
	Furthermore, TSM does not try to establish a new terminal emulation standard, but instead
	keeps compatibility as close to xterm as possible. This is why the TERM variable can be
	set to xterm-color256 with any TSM based terminal emulator.
