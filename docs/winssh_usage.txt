Usage: slogin [-46CdnqTtV] [-e escape_char|-E] [-o option[,option]...]
            [-b bind_address] [-l <user-name> [-p <port>] [-KPI] [user[:password]@]host

  The slogin utility starts a terminal session on a remote host using SSH2 as its transport and authorization
  mechanisms. It is intended to provide secure encrypted communications between two untrusted hosts over an insecure
  network.

  slogin connects and logs into the specified hostname (with optional user name). The user must prove his/her identity
  to the remote machine using one of several methods (see below).

  Once a connection has been establised, 'slogin' provides a vt220/xterm terminal emulation allowing advanced console
  applications to be executed. The window size changes is also copied to the remote system if the server supports
  the option.

  Available command line options:

    -4                           Forces use of IPv4 addresses only.

    -6                           Forces use of IPv6 addresses only.

    -b bind_address              Use bind_address on the local machine as the source address of the connection.
                                 Only useful on systems with more than one network interface.

    -C                           Enables data compression.

    -d                           Enable socket debug.

    -n                           Enable socket non-delay.

    -e escape_char               Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default:`~'). The escape character
                                 is only recognized at the beginning of a line. This specification may be as a literal
                                 character, or as an octal value in the form \nnn. Stating the character as 'none'
                                 disables any escape processing; as same -E.

    -E                           Disables escape character processing.

    -l username                  Specifies the user name to log in as on the remote machine.

    -o option[=value],...        General option configuration. Options are specified with an -o flag followed by a
                                 comma separated string of options with an associated optional value of the form
                                 'option=value'. The option is used for specifying options for which there is no
                                 separate command-line flag.

                                 One or more '-o' arguments may be stated with the results accumulating, for example:

                                    -o SetVarRC=1 -o Port=22,User=admin -o KeepAliveInterval=30 -o SetVarX=2

                                 Note that 'SetVar' is an exception permitting only a single option per '-o' switch
                                 to allow embedded spaces and commas. For available options and their possible values,
                                 see below.

    -p port                      Port to connect to on the remote host (default: 22).

    -q                           Quiet mode; minimal diagnostics.

    -T                           Disable pseudo-terminal allocation.

    -t terminal_name             Force pseudo-terminal allocation. This can be used to execute arbitrary screen-based
                                 programs on a remote machine.

    -V                           Display the version details and exit.

  Available configuration options:

    AddressFamily
            Address family selection. Specifies which address family to use when connecting. Valid arguments are 'any',
            `inet' (IPv4 only), or `inet6' (IPv6 only). The default is 'any'.

    Authentication
            Authentication type selection. Specifies the sema-colon seperated list of authentication types, if
            available to be utilised during session creation.
            Available authentication methods:
                 o 'password'
                 o 'keyboard[-interactive]'
                 o 'publickey'

    BatchMode
            Terminal interactive mode selection. If set to 'yes', both passphrase/password querying will be disabled.
            This option is useful in scripts and other batch jobs where no user is available to supply the password.
            Valid arguments are 'yes' or 'no'. The default is 'no'.

    BindAddress
            Explicit local bind address.Use the specified address on the local machine as the source address of the
            connection. Only useful on systems with more than one interface.

    Compression
            Data compression state. Specifies whether to use data compression. The argument must be 'yes' or 'no'. The
            default is 'no'. libssh2 supports zlib based compression, which must also be enabled on the server.

    EscapeCharacter
            Terminal escape character. Sets the escape character for sessions with a pty (default:`~'). The escape
            character marks the introduction of control commands to the local terminal driver, for example '~.'
            terminates the session. The escape character is only recognized at the beginning of a line. This
            specification may be as a literal character, or as an octal value in the form \nnn. Stating the character
            as 'none' disables any escape processing.

    KeepAliveInterval
            Keepalive timeout interval. Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data transmitted,
            slogin shall send a keep-alive message request. The default is 0, indicating that keep-alives shall not be
            sent to the server.

    MaxColors
            Max terminal colors 8, 16, 88 or 256

    Port
            Server port: default 22

    PseudoTerminal
            Enable pseudo terminal eumlation.

    Quiet
            Quiet mode.

    SetEnv
            Set server environment variable. Specifies the value an environment variable which is sent to the server.
            The server must also support it, and the server must be configured to accept these environment variables.
            Up to a maximum of 128 variables may be stated using the form 'SetEnv NAME[=VALUE]'. If variable is stated
            without a value the local environment variable of the same name is imported. Note that the TERM environment
            variable is always sent whenever a pseudo-terminal is requested as it is required by the protocol.

    StricthostKeyChecking
            Enable strict known host file checks. If set to `yes', slogin will never automatically add host keys to the
            known_hosts file, and shall refuse to connect to hosts whose host key has changed.

    TerminalName
            Terminal name. Specifies the name of the pseudo-terminal that is requested during pty creation. The
            interval terminal emumations is reasonability generic and should behave under either a vt220 or xterm
            flavoured termcap/terminfo specification.

    User
            Specifies the user to log in as on the remote machine. Useful when a alternative user name(s) are used on
            different machines.
