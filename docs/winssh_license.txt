        winssh contains code from the following third-party components

        o LIBSSH2       - The ssh library.

                libssh2 is a client-side C library implementing the SSH2 protocol

                Source: https://www.libssh2.org

        o zlib          - A Massively Spiffy Yet Delicately Unobtrusive Compression Library

                zlib is designed to be a free, general-purpose, legally unencumbered -- that is,
                not covered by any patents -- lossless data-compression library for use on
                virtually any computer hardware and operating system. The zlib data format is
                itself portable across platforms. Unlike the LZW compression method used in Unix
                compress(1) and in the GIF image format, the compression method currently used in
                zlib essentially never expands the data. (LZW can double or triple the file size
                in extreme cases.) zlib's memory footprint is also independent of the input data
                and can be reduced, if necessary, at some cost in compression. A more precise,
                technical discussion of both points is available on another page.

                zlib was written by Jean-loup Gailly (compression) and Mark Adler
                (decompression). Jean-loup is also the primary author of gzip(1), the author of
                the comp.compression FAQ list and the former maintainer of Info-ZIP's Zip; Mark
                is also the author of gzip's and UnZip's main decompression routines and was the
                original author of Zip. Not surprisingly, the compression algorithm used in zlib
                is essentially the same as that in gzip and Zip, namely, the `deflate' method
                that originated in PKWARE's PKZIP 2.x.

        o libtsm        - Terminal-emulator State Machine

                TSM is a state machine for DEC VT100-VT520 compatible terminal emulators. It
                tries to support all common standards while keeping compatibility to existing
                emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal, konsole, ..

                TSM itself does not provide any rendering nor window management. It is a simple
                plain state machine without any external dependencies. It can be used to
                implement terminal emulators, but also to implement other applications that need
                to interpret terminal escape sequences.

                This library is very similar to libvte of the gnome project. However, libvte is
                highly bound to GTK+, which makes it unsuitable for non-graphics projects that
                need to parse escape sequences. Instead, TSM tries to restrict its API to
                terminal emulation only. Furthermore, TSM does not try to establish a new
                terminal emulation standard, but instead keeps compatibility as close to xterm as
                possible. This is why the TERM variable can be set to xterm-color256 with any TSM
                based terminal emulator.
